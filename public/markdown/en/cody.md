#### 📜 Project Overview
Cody is a versatile Discord bot crafted in **C#** using **DSharpPlus**. It was created for Kaizen's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/improve), where I serve as the Community Manager.

Kaizen is a community for students and life-long learners aiming to achieve freedom doing work they love. It's a place to collaborate, motivate, and work together to achieve that goal.

Cody delivers an array of valuable features for the server while using a **MySQL** database to efficiently store data:
