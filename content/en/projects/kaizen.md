## ⏱️ Pomodoro Timer

The foundation of Kaizen. A beautifully designed timer with customizable work sessions (5-90 min) and break durations. It keeps running accurately even when you switch apps or lock your phone, and notifies you when sessions end with sound and vibration options. Auto-start options let you seamlessly flow between sessions and breaks.

## 👥 Focus Rooms

Study together, even when you're apart. Focus Rooms bring the body doubling technique to your pocket. Create public or private rooms for 2-50 members with real-time presence, live timer sync across all members, and automatic idle detection to ensure genuine engagement.

## ✅ Task Management

Tap a task, start focusing, and Kaizen tracks your time automatically. Create tasks with priorities, due dates, subtasks, and time estimates. No more guessing where your time went.

## 📊 Statistics & Streaks

Track your focus time, session history, and daily streaks to build consistent habits. Heatmaps and charts show your focus patterns by hour, completion rates, and insights into your productivity. All synced to the cloud across your devices.
