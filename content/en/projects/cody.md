Cody is a versatile Discord bot crafted in **C#** using **DSharpPlus**. It was created for Kaizen's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/improve), where I serve as the Community Manager.

Kaizen is a community for students and life-long learners aiming to achieve freedom doing work they love. It's a place to collaborate, motivate, and work together to achieve that goal.

Cody delivers an array of valuable features for the server while using a **MySQL** database to efficiently store data:

## ✨ Features

- 📝 **Message & Study Logs**: Keep tabs on server activity with message logging. Empower users to track their study time with the `/studytime` command, which provides detailed statistics over a day, week, month, or all time. Use `/studycheck` to check your study time at a specific moment, and compete with others on the study leaderboard using `/studyboard`.
- 📊 **Studygraphs**: Use the `/studygraph` command to visualize your study progress with detailed graphs. Track your study habits over time and identify areas for improvement.
- ⏲️ **Pomodoro Power**: Boost productivity with the `/pomodoro` command, which starts a highly customizable Pomodoro timer, supporting multiplayer sessions for synchronized focus.
- 📋 **Task Management**: Organize your to-dos effortlessly with the `/todo` command.
- 🎓 **Educational Assistance**: Search for universities, define words, and convert time zones with `/university`, `/dictionary`, and `/timestamp`.
- 🚀 **Server Productivity**: Receive motivation, report issues confidentially, and enjoy delightful GIFs of cats and dogs with `/motivation`, `/report`, `/cat`, and `/dog`.
